# Java-Absolute-Project-1

In an ancient land, the beutiful princess Eve many suitors. 
She decided on the following procedute to determine which suitor she would marry. 

First, all of the suitors would be lined up one after the other and assigned numbers. 

The first suitor would be number 1, the second number 2, and so on up to the last suitor, number n.

Starting at the suitor in the first position, she would then count three suitors down the line (because of the three letters in her name), and
the third suitor would be eliminated from winning her hand and removed from the line. Eve woudl then continue, counting three more suitors, and
eliminate every third suitor. 

When she reached the end of the line, she would continue from beginning.

For example, if there were six suitors, the elimination process would proceed as follows:

123456  Initial list of suitors; start counting from 1.
12456   Suitor 3 eliminated; continue counting from 4.
1245    Suitor 6 eliminated; continue counting from 1.
125     Suitor 4 eliminated; continue counting from 5.
15      Suitor 2 eliminated; continue counting from 5.
1       Suitor 5 eliminated; 1 is the lucky winner.


Assignment

Write a program that creates a cirucular linked list of nodes to determine which position you should stand in to marry the princes if there are n suitors.

Your program should simulate the elimination process be deleting the node that corresponds to the suitor that is eliminated for each step in the process.
